    "One of the most common curiosities among Instagram users is whether the people they follow are also following them back. There are numerous apps available on the App Store and Google Play Store designed to answer this question. However, the reliability of these apps often leaves users with many doubts and concerns. Considering this, I have conceived a solution that utilizes basic coding and a Google extension, allowing for a reliable and simple approach to uncover this information. In this article, I will share with you how to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "While integrating Instagram's API could potentially make this process faster and provide real-time data, I will not delve into this aspect in our discussion. This approach aims to offer a secure and straightforward method, steering clear of the complexities and potential trust issues associated with third-party apps.\n",

    "- The IG Follower Export Tool extension developed for Chrome\n",
    "- A Python editor (I personally use and recommend Jupyter)"

    "\n",
    "After entering the username or link in the \"IG User or URL\" section, you can select a delay from the dropdown menu and click on \"Start new parsing\". The reason for adding a delay is because Instagram prevents scraping. You should set a larger timeout if you encounter issues. The timeout is set in seconds. Then, in the bottom right corner, you can monitor the total number of people and the status in the \"Progress\" section. When the status changes to 'Finished', you can download the file by clicking the 'save to excel' button."
